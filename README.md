# YoloPunch
YoloPunch is a social platform for sharing challenges with friends. It's my first Django project :)
##Idea
Create a challenge, assign it to a friend, wait till he or she completes it, accept or deny the response. Your friend and you get the points for your actions, unlock badges and earn reputation. When creating a challenge, you can set the amount of $ you would like to dontate for charity, and if your friend completes the challenge, you donate the specified amount to for charity from his name.

###Project Status
